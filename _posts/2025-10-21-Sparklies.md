**Overview**

For this project, I’ve been coding three LEDs to copy how different fireflies light up. Each one has its own pattern and timing. The Flash Bulb gives a short bright flash every few seconds, the Big Dipper slowly glows brighter until it fades out, and the Synchronous blinks three quick times in a row. Right now, I’m working on them one at a time to make sure each pattern looks right before putting them all together.


**Tip to past self:**

Don’t get frustrated when it doesn’t work the first time—it never does. Just keep testing small changes until the pattern finally looks right.
