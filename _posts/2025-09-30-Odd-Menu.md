This assignment was about writing a C program that uses nested if statements to create a restaurant menu. The program asks the user for a number to decide whether to show the regular menu or the secret menu, then asks for a meal option from 1–3 and prints the selected dish. It also gives an error message if the user enters an invalid option.

**Tip:**
Start by getting the program to just print the right menu before worrying about all the meal options — breaking it into steps makes it so much easier.
