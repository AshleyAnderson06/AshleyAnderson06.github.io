My name is Ashley Anderson, and I’m a freshman at Williams College. I’m currently undecided on my major, but I love exploring and learning new things. I’ve been sewing since I was little, spending one summer at fashion camp and making dresses for my dolls. While I wouldn’t call myself an expert, I’m confident enough to create pieces that can hold together.

I don’t have much programming experience (unless you count a two-week robotics class in fifth grade), but I’m excited to learn the basics of programming, get more comfortable with technology, and expand my sewing skills in new ways.

One very boring fact about me is that I don’t use social media.
