This project was designed with homemade switches using conductive fabric, conductive thread, and a paperclip. I created one switch on either side of the battery, both leading to the LED. When both switches are activated, when the cow licks its nose and when the paperclip touches the middle of the flower, the LED in the bee lights up.

**Tip** Tip to past self: Trace out your design on the fabric and place and connect all the components first. Do not start by sewing the decorative design so you can cover any exposed conductive material later with aesthetically pleasing stitches.
