This project started with a simple alligator-clip prototype that powered three LED lights from a battery. I then added a button and a switch on each side between the battery and the LEDs. From there, I drew on my past embroidery experience to stitch the LilyPad technology and the battery into a plushy cut-out. Using conductive thread and a running stitch, I connected the battery through the switches to the LEDsâ€”making sure to keep positives connected to positives and negatives to negatives. Finally, I stitched the two sides of the plushy together with a whip stitch and filled it with cotton balls. Now, when you flip the switches, the plushy lights up and looks delightfully demonic. :)

**Tip**
Draw out your prototype on a piece of paper first, and if you plan to put the battery on the opposite side from the LEDs, make sure you flip it on your drawing too.
