title: SWEATER WEATHER!
author: Ashley Anderson

I made a c program that prints what to wear based on an int temperature. It uses a simple if / else if / else chain using both and and or statements. The code accounts for all temperature ranges including dangerous temperatures. I used || for extremes (<0 or >105) and one && for the 60–75 range. I tested temps : -50, 0, 25, 50, 65, and 100 to produce 6 different answers.

**Tip to past self:**
Keep the code simple—use one clear if / else if / else chain and use fewer &&/||
