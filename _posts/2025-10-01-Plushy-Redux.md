I wrote a C program that replicates how the Plushyâ€™s button and switch control the three LEDs. By setting the button and switch to 0 or 1, the program prints whether each LED is ON or OFF.

**Tip:**
Start by writing out the table for the button and switch. It makes the logic click right away and keeps you from overthinking the code.
