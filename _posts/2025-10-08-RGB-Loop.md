**Description**

This program uses a while loop to print a color every 10th time the loop runs. It cycles through red, green, and blue, printing each one three times before switching to the next color. Using a loop and a couple of variables makes it easy to keep the pattern going without repeating multiple lines of code.

**Tip:**

Make sure to keep your code lined up so it’s easy to read, and don’t forget to close all your brackets.
