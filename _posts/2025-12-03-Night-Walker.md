# **Night Walker**

We all have those winter days where we get home from school or work late at night, and our dogs are already waiting by the door, desperate for a walk. But going out in the dark can feel scary—especially if your dogs, like mine, aren’t exactly leash-loving. As humans, we have tons of ways to stay visible at night: reflective vests, bright clothes, flashlights… plus drivers are usually looking for us.

Our dogs, however lovable they are, don’t always get that same attention.

That’s why I created this light-up dog collar.

After a quick buzzer alert lets you know the collar is connected and working, all you have to do is step outside. In the dark, the collar automatically lights up with red warning LEDs to catch the attention of drivers and keep your dog safe.

The light-sensor feature also matters for your sanity and your dog’s comfort. If your dog goes outside at night, the collar turns on by itself. But once they’re back inside — maybe taking a nap on the couch — the lights stay off. No bright LEDs flashing in your living room, and no need to constantly switch the collar on and off every time your dog wants to go out again.

Overall, it’s simple, safe, and makes late-night winter walks a little less stressful for everyone.

# **Tips to my past self:**

1. Fabric paint is not durable enough to separate crossing wires. Use instead, embroidery thread or fabric.

2. Make sure that your code is not set up so that components that are not meant to rely on each other don't rely on each other's activation to function

3. Make sure that the pins you are connecting specific functions to are compatible with that function otherwise you are going to pull your hair out wondering why it doesn't work.
