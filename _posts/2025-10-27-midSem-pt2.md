**Project**

I programmed three LED sets—Flash Bulb, Big Dipper, and Synchronous—to run at the same time, each following its own blink pattern on a repeating 10-second cycle in one Arduino sketch.

**Tip:**

Make sure to auto-format your code before uploading. It’s way easier to read and spot mistakes when everything lines up cleanly.
