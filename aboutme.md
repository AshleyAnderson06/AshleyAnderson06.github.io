I am taking Electronic Textiles to dive into the world of coding and creation. As someone who values understanding and developing skill sets across many fields, I think it is especially important to understand the basics of electronic function. Electronics are ever-present in our daily lives, driving everything from wearable technology to larger systems. This course will allow me to explore the fundamentals of computer science through a uniquely creative lens, transferring digital creation into the physical world. I will not only be able to build solutions that are functional, but also creatively original.
